Project Name: Building an Agent Based Model
Author: Rashad a.k. Ahmed
Version: I/O v.2 (08.03.2019)

This code generates 10 simple agents represented by a set of random
coordinates in a confined 2D space.
The agents take 100 steps in random directions, and handle edges like pac-man
The final position of the agents are printed and plotted.
